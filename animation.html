    <h1>Transitions</h1>
    <div class="example-box example-transition">
        Go over me, a transition is applied.

    <h1>Multiple Keyframes</h1>

    <h1>Animation Fill Mode</h1>
    <div class="example-box fill-mode-forwards">
        Forwards: the target will retain the computed values set by the last keyframe encountered during execution.
    </div>
    <div class="example-box fill-mode-backwards">
        Backwards: the animation will apply the values defined in the first relevant keyframe as soon as it is applied to the target,
        and retain this during the animation-delay period.
    </div>
    <div class="example-box fill-mode-none">
        None: the animation will not apply any styles to the target when it's not executing.
        The element will instead be displayed using any other CSS rules applied to it. This is the default value.

    <h1>Animation Direction</h1>
    <div class="example-box animation-direction-normal">
        Normal: the animation plays forwards each cycle. In other words, each time the animation cycles,
        the animation will reset to the beginning state and start over again. This is the default value.
    </div>
    <div class="example-box animation-direction-reverse">
        Reverse: the animation plays backwards each cycle.
        In other words, each time the animation cycles, the animation will reset to the end state and start over again.
    </div>
    <div class="example-box animation-direction-alternate">
        Alternate: the animation reverses direction each cycle, with the first iteration being played forwards.
    </div>
    <div class="example-box animation-direction-alternate-reverse">
        Alternate-reverse: the animation reverses direction each cycle, with the first iteration being played backwards.
